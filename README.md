## Hi there 👋

My name is Patrick, and I'm an MSc Data Science Student at Trinity College Dublin, interested in ethical AI development!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my dissertation, which uses PyTorch and Raytune to test various hyperparameter optimisation techniques compared against a ground truth to identify the best optimisation methods to use given different input data and scenarios.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and bias reduction in Large Language models, including techniques like counterfactual explanation methods, post hoc approaches like 
feature attribution methods, perturbation-based techniques and concept and examples-based methods.
- ☘️ In addition to this, I am also developing an AI-driven Irish language learning app that will allow users to practice oral conversations and improve their pronunciation for multiple dialects.
- 🎬 I am also developing a script learning app driven by my love of acting, which allows users to practice their lines with AI actors. Users can do full practice runs of entire scripts with the application, allowing them to rehearse an entire play, scene or monologue by themselves anywhere they wish! 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source explainable AI projects focusing on identifying and mitigating bias in Large Language Model outputs.
